What this project says about me:
I love solving problems and enjoy applying what I've learned
in ALX. This is a milestone project,
marking the beginning of many amazing projects I plan to embark on.

My struggles and things I would love to improve on in this project:

In this project, the chat page works very well when I run the Flas
app locally, but after hosting it, the chat functionality stops
working.
I have tried several solutions to fix this issue, but it remains
unresolved.

I am also working to improve the security of the app by preventing
spam registrations, implementing email authentication, and adding
password recovery features.

For the backend, I used Python, as I wanted to deepen my knowledge
and apply it to solve real-world problems. The registration system
is built with SQLAlchemy and served using a Flask app. The client
side is developed with JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. JavaScript was
the ideal choice because it is widely used, easy to maintain,
and highly reusable for such projects.
