In this project, I am learnig RestApi. Rest mean Representation State Trasfer. I have read something about it but this is how I understand it.

Representation does the work of bringing the response to the caller(user) in the form of Json(javascript object notation) and state transfer implies that its resopnse is according to the state of the state of the server as at when the request is made

the transfer simply implies that the response is being transfered in json format to the caller


API means Aplication progaram interface. This simply says that the caller is making the request from an application program in his device
